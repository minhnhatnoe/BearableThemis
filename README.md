# BearableThemis

Some scripts to make online mode of Themis (essentially the Vietnamese version of CMS) more bearable

## TODOs:

1. Self type annotation (when Python 3.11 is released)
2. Use the @dataclass decorator for Submission class to make code more readable
3. Implement portals as async generators
